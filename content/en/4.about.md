A few words about me

#intro
Full-Stack Developer based in East Jakarta, Indonesia.

With professional experience since 2022, I specialize in building modern web and mobile applications using technologies such as React, Next.js, Vue, Nuxt, and Node.js. I focus on clean code, lightweight performance, and minimalist design, ensuring scalable and user-friendly solutions.

I thrive both independently and within collaborative teams, continuously learning and adapting to new technologies to deliver high-quality products.
